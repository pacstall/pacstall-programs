# Contributing

## PR Etiquette

* Please **do not** click the "Update branch" button every time your branch is out of date. This will cause unnecessary spam to our Discord, will waste the CIs time, and clutter the squash commit.
* Please test your package locally before creating a PR. Preferably you should test on your own computer, along with the [Pacstall docker container](https://github.com/pacstall/repo-maintain/pkgs/container/pacstall). We are not your package testers, nor should you expect us to be. We may help you along the way, but do not ask us to test. That is your job.
* Use the "Add suggestion to batch" button to group related suggestions into a single commit, instead of making multiple commits.
