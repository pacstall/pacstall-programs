## Creating a PR
* Please **do not** create Pacscripts on GitHub. We use pre-commit to ensure that our repo is of the highest quality, and using GitHub will bypass those checks. We **will not** accept any PR suspected of being made entirely using tools that do not use git directly.

## PR Etiquette

* Please **do not** click the "Update branch" button every time your branch is out of date. This will cause unnecessary spam to our Discord, will waste the CIs time, and clutter the squash commit.
* Please test your package locally before creating a PR. Preferably you should test on your own computer, along with the [Pacstall docker container](https://github.com/pacstall/repo-maintain/pkgs/container/pacstall). We are not your package testers, nor should you expect us to be. We may help you along the way, but do not ask us to test. That is your job.
* Use the "Add suggestion to batch" button to group related suggestions into a single commit, instead of making multiple commits.
