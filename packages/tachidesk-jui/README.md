# TachideskJUI

A free and open source manga reader to read manga from a Tachidesk server.

TachideskJUI can run the Tachidesk server on its own, or connect to an already hosted server.

**Notes:** Keep in mind that TachideskJUI and Tachidesk are alpha software TachideskJUI is still in alpha. The current released build for linux is, in most cases, unable to run it's built-in Tachidesk server.

For usability, this pacscript rebuilds the Tachidesk server jar, without webUI. The desktop entry and the bash file included runs both Tachidesk and TachideskJUI at the same time.
