> Flash OS images to SD cards & USB drives, safely and easily.

Etcher is a powerful OS image flasher built with web technologies to ensure
flashing an SDCard or USB drive is a pleasant and safe experience. It protects
you from accidentally writing to your hard-drives, ensures every byte of data
was written correctly, and much more. It can also directly flash Raspberry Pi devices that support [USB device boot mode](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/device.md).
