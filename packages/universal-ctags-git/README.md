# Universal Ctags

[Universal Ctags](https://ctags.io/) (abbreviated as u-ctags) is a *maintained*
implementation of `ctags`.
`ctags` generates an index (or tag) file of language objects found in source
files for programming languages.
This index makes it easy for text editors and other tools to locate the indexed
items.
